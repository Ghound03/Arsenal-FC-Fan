            <h2 class="history">Arsenal FC: A Legacy of Passion and Success</h2>
            <p>Founded in <strong>1886</strong> as <strong>Dial Square</strong>, Arsenal Football Club has grown from humble beginnings to become one of the most successful and celebrated clubs in English football. 
               Originally based in <strong>Woolwich</strong>, South London, the club moved to <strong>North London</strong> in <strong>1913</strong>, establishing itself at the iconic <strong>Highbury Stadium</strong>.</p>
        
            <p>Arsenal became a powerhouse under the legendary manager <strong>Herbert Chapman</strong> in the 1930s, revolutionizing English football with innovative tactics and securing multiple league titles. 
               The club continued to thrive, earning its reputation as a dominant force in domestic competitions.</p>
        
            <p>The <strong>Arsène Wenger</strong> era (1996–2018) transformed Arsenal's identity, bringing a modern, attacking style of play and winning numerous trophies, including the historic 
               <strong>2003–04 Invincibles season</strong>, where Arsenal remained unbeaten throughout the Premier League campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Now playing at the <strong>Emirates Stadium</strong>, Arsenal remains a global football giant, celebrated for its commitment to attractive football, youth development, and a rich legacy of triumph and resilience.</p>
